# MindMosaic - Student Assisting App

## Introduction

In today's fast-paced academic environment, students often struggle to stay organized, manage their time effectively, and retain information efficiently. To address these challenges, we have developed "MindMosaic," a comprehensive student assisting app that combines essential features such as flashcards, to-do lists, note-taking, a stopwatch, and a secure login/sign-up system. This README provides an overview of the app's functionality and its potential benefits for students.

## Features

### Flashcards

The flashcard feature helps you prepare for future interviews. It comes with pre-defined questions about computer science topics. By using these flashcards, you can practice and improve your knowledge and skills in areas like algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving. Whether you're a student or a professional, these flashcards will boost your confidence and help you succeed in computer science interviews and land your dream job.
